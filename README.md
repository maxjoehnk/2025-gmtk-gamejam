Loopscape

We find the hole in your loop.

Loopscape is a top-down stealth puzzle game where planning beats reflexes. You play as a prisoner trying to escape a heavily guarded facility but instead of moving in real time, you program your path in advance.

Once you’ve entered your sequence of moves, you press play and watch your character execute the path. If you get caught, the loop resets and everyone returns to their original positions. But you keep what you’ve learned.

Adjust your inputs, tweak your timing and refine your strategy. The guards follow predictable patrol routes. The cameras rotate on cycles. Can you spot the pattern?

Optimize your moves and carve out the one perfect path to freedom.

Can you master the loop... and escape it?
